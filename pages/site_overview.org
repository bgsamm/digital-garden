The following are the primary "mantras" I am keeping in mind as I
build this site:

1. *Have fun with it* - This website is meant as a creative outlet and
   means of personal expression, so my own enjoyment and interest will
   always take priority over concerns like practicality.
2. *Put a pin in it* - I always want to be able to put a project down
   if my interests have shifted, with the knowledge that I have
   systems in place to facilitate picking up where I left off in the
   future.
3. *Reinvent the wheel* - I find reimplementing something (if it's
   something I'm interested in) far more rewarding and instructive
   than using someone else's solution, even if the final result is of
   inferior quality.
4. *"Good enough" is good enough* - I want systems for leaving
   something incomplete or imperfect, and for recording how I might
   like to improve it or extend it in the future (similar to 2)
5. *Make it public* - I want to err on the side of expressing
   interests, making mistakes, and being wrong out in the open.
6. *Don't be silly, wrap your... dependencies* - Always wrap
   dependencies to make them easy to replace later!
7. *Follow the data* - Programs should always be designed around the
   data they manipulate.

*** Non-goals

**** TODO Add link to Principles-(4) in 2
**** TODO Add link to Principles-(4) in 3
**** TODO Add "and that's good enough" (Frank Ocean, Nikes) quote to 4
**** TODO Either "Show me the money" (Jerry Maguire) or "Follow the money" (All the President's Men) for 7; also "The purpose of all programs..." Mike Acton quote

The following are explicit non-goals of this project, meaning I am intentionally deprioritizing them:

1. *Mobile friendly design* - Fuck phones.
2. *Cross-browser compatibility* - I'm not going to stress about making sure
   the website looks and functions identically across all versions of
   all browsers on all platforms. As long as it looks good on the
   latest version of FireFox, I'm content.
3. *Production-quality code* - While it's great if others find my code
   useful, I make no claims as to its robustness nor commitments to
   its maintenance.
